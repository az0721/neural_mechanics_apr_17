# Model Overview

## Description:
Gemma 4 31B IT is an open multimodal model built by Google DeepMind that handles text and image inputs, can process video as sequences of frames, and generates text output. It is designed to deliver frontier-level performance for reasoning, agentic workflows, coding, and multimodal understanding on consumer GPUs and workstations, with a 256K-token context window and support for over 140 languages. The model uses a hybrid attention mechanism that interleaves local sliding-window and full global attention, with unified Keys and Values in global layers and Proportional RoPE (p-RoPE) to support long-context performance. The NVIDIA Gemma 4 31B IT NVFP4 model is quantized with [NVIDIA Model Optimizer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer).

This model is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.  <br>

## Post Training Quantization
This model was obtained by quantizing the weights and activations of Gemma-4-31B-IT-NVFP4 to NVFP4 data type, ready for inference with vLLM.  

## Usage

To serve this checkpoint with [vLLM]( 0.17.2rc1.dev104+gae521202f.d20260319.cu128) and run the sample command below:

```sh
vllm serve /models/gemma-4-31b-it-nvfp4 --quantization modelopt --tensor-parallel-size 8
```


## Evaluation Results:

| Benchmark | Baseline (ours) | NVFP4 |
|---|---|---|
| GPQA Diamond | 75.71% | 75.46% |
| AIME 2025 | 66.25% | 65.94% |
| MMLU Pro | 85.25% | 84.94% |
| LiveCodeBench (pass@1) | 70.90% | 70.63% |
| Scicode subtask acc (pass@1) | 33.61% | 33.18% |
| Terminal-Bench Hard (pass@1) | 27.08% | 27.08% |

## Model Limitations:
The base model was trained on data that contains toxic language and societal biases originally crawled from the internet. Therefore, the model may amplify those biases and return toxic responses especially when prompted with toxic prompts. The model may generate answers that may be inaccurate, omit key information, or include irrelevant or redundant text producing socially unacceptable or undesirable text, even if the prompt itself does not include anything explicitly offensive.

## Ethical Considerations
